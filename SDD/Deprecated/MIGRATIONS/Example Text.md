| 1  | PHILO       | "Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front..." | "No, but our general's excessive adoration has exceeded all limits. Those noble eyes, once stern in the turmoil of war, now soften and shift in adoration towards a dark complexion..." |
| 2  | DEMETRIUS   | "Look, where they come: Take but good note, and you shall see in him. The triple pillar of the world transform'd Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see." | "Just observe him and you'll see. The man who was once seen as one of the world's main supports has now become merely a plaything for a seductress. Just look." |
| 3  | CLEOPATRA   | "If it be love indeed, tell me how much." | "If you truly love me, tell me how much." |
| 4  | MARK ANTONY | "There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd." | "Love that can be measured is hardly love at all." |
| 5  | CLEOPATRA   | "I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved." | "I'll set a limit to how much you should love me." |
| 6  | MARK ANTONY | "Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth." | "Then you'd have to create a new universe for that amount of love." |
| 7  | ATTENDANT   | "News, my good lord, from Rome." | "There's news from Rome, my lord." |
| 8  | MARK ANTONY | "Grates me: the sum." | "The details annoy me. Tell me the summary." |
| 9  | CLEOPATRA   | "Nay, hear them, Antony: Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this; Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that; Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'" | "Listen to them, Antony. Maybe Fulvia is upset; or who knows if Caesar hasn't sent a direct order to you, saying 'Do this, or else; conquer that kingdom, grant them freedom; follow through, or we'll condemn you.'" |
| 10 | MARK ANTONY | "How, my love!" | "What, my love!" |
| 11 | CLEOPATRA   | "Perchance! nay, and most like: You must not stay here longer, your dismission Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony. Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both? Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen..." | "Maybe! And it's very likely. You cannot stay here any longer; Caesar has ordered your return. So, listen to it, Antony. Where's the official order from Fulvia? Or is it from Caesar? Both? Bring in the messengers..." |
| 12 | MARK ANTONY | "Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space. Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair..." | "Let Rome dissolve in the Tiber, and the vast arch of its empire collapse! This is where I stand. Kingdoms are just clay; our earth nourishes beasts as it does men..." |
| 13 | CLEOPATRA   | "Excellent falsehood! Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her? I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony Will be himself." | "Such a brilliant lie! Why did he marry Fulvia if he didn't love her? I might play the fool, but I'm not one; Antony will return to his true self." |
| 14 | MARK ANTONY | "But stirr'd by Cleopatra. Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours, Let's not confound the time with conference harsh: There's not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?" | "But only moved by you, Cleopatra. Now, for the sake of love and the gentle moments we share, let's not spoil our time with harsh discussions. There should be no moment in our lives without some joy. What entertainment do we have tonight?" |
| 15 | CLEOPATRA   | "Hear the ambassadors." | "Listen to the ambassadors." |
| 16 | MARK ANTONY | "Fie, wrangling queen! Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh, To weep; whose every passion fully strives To make itself, in thee, fair and admired! No messenger, but thine; and all alone To-night we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people. Come, my queen; Last night you did desire it: speak not to us." | "Oh, you quarrelsome queen! Everything suits you: to scold, to laugh, to weep. Every passion of yours strives to make itself look graceful and admirable in you. No messenger but yours tonight; and we'll wander the streets alone, observing the lives of people. Come, my queen; you wished for it last night. Let's not talk to anyone else." |
| 17 | DEMETRIUS   | "Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?" | "Is Caesar valued so little by Antony now?" |
| 18 | PHILO       | "Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony, He comes too short of that great property Which still should go with Antony." | "Well, sometimes, when he's not being Antony, he falls short of that significant quality that should accompany him." |
| 19 | DEMETRIUS   | "I am full sorry That he approves the common liar, who Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!" | "I'm truly sorry that he proves the common liar, who speaks of him in Rome, right: but I hope for better actions tomorrow. Rest you happy!" |
| 20 | PHILO       | "Thus, our dear general is much missed. Who, once upon the waves of great battles, shone like the god of war; now bends his mighty spirit to the soft and tender whispers of love. But let us hope, as we watch him submit to love's sweet yoke, that tomorrow will bring back the lion's roar we know him for. Rest you happy!" | "So, our beloved general has changed. Once a fierce warrior in battle, now he's captivated by love's gentle grip. Yet, we hold out hope that tomorrow may revive the formidable leader we admire. Be at ease and content." |
