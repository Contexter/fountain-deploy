# Aggregating Web Traffic Monitoring with GoAccess: A Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial outlines how to aggregate and monitor web traffic across multiple web hosts using GoAccess, an open-source real-time web log analyzer. By aggregating logs, you gain a unified view of traffic across your entire infrastructure, which is invaluable for performance tuning, security monitoring, and understanding user behavior.

## Current Status of Web Traffic Monitoring

Monitoring web traffic typically involves analyzing logs generated by web servers such as Nginx or Apache. In environments hosting multiple web services or virtual hosts, each host might log traffic data separately, making comprehensive analysis challenging.

## Common Configuration Practices

1. **Log Aggregation**:
   - **Single File**: For small setups, configuring all hosts to log to a single file simplifies analysis but can lead to cluttered logs.
   - **Separate Files and Merging**: More commonly, logs are kept separate for clarity and merged for analysis. Use `cat`, `zcat` (for compressed logs), or `logrotate` scripts to merge logs periodically or in real-time before feeding them into GoAccess.

2. **Real-Time Analysis**:
   - Use GoAccess's real-time functionality by piping merged logs directly into GoAccess or setting up a cron job to periodically merge logs and analyze them with GoAccess.

3. **Using GoAccess in Daemon Mode**:
   - Running GoAccess as a system service ensures continuous monitoring. Configure the service to read from a live-updating log file that aggregates data from all hosts.

## Compliance Considerations

When aggregating logs, especially those containing personal data like IP addresses, compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) is crucial:

1. **Data Minimization and Anonymization**: Only retain and analyze necessary data. Consider anonymizing IP addresses and other identifiable information.

2. **Secure Storage and Access**: Ensure aggregated logs are stored securely and only accessible to authorized personnel. Use encryption for data at rest and in transit.

3. **Transparency and Legal Basis**: Update privacy policies to reflect the aggregation and analysis practices. Ensure there's a legal basis for processing personal data, such as user consent or a legitimate interest justification.

4. **Retention Policy**: Implement a clear retention policy for logs, keeping them only as long as necessary for the purposes they were collected.

## Conclusion

Aggregating and analyzing web traffic with GoAccess provides a comprehensive view of your web infrastructure's health and usage. By following best practices for log management and adhering to compliance standards, you can gain valuable insights while respecting user privacy and regulatory requirements.

This guide should serve as a starting point for effectively monitoring web traffic across multiple hosts with GoAccess, ensuring both operational efficiency and compliance with privacy laws.
