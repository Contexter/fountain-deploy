### Problem : Python3 is missing
```
root@ubuntu:~/RedisGraph# make
deps/readies/mk/main:49: *** Cannot find python3 interpreter.
You can install one by running 'make setup'..  Stop.
root@ubuntu:~/RedisGraph# make setup
# Building into /src
# Using CC=gcc
make: *** No rule to make target 'setup'.  Stop.
```
The error message you are encountering indicates that the RedisGraph compilation process is unable to find a Python 3 interpreter on your system. RedisGraph's build system relies on Python for its setup scripts. Let's resolve this issue step-by-step:

### 1. Install Python 3
First, ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can install Python 3 on Ubuntu 20.04 using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

This will install Python 3 and pip (Python's package installer) on your system.

### 2. Verify Python Installation
You can verify that Python 3 is installed by checking its version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

This should output something like `Python 3.8.10` (the exact version might vary).

### 3. Set Python 3 as the Default Python Interpreter (if necessary)
If `python` is still pointing to Python 2.x, or if it's not set, you might want to make `python3` the default Python interpreter. This is optional but recommended:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
```

### 4. Re-attempt to Compile RedisGraph
Now that Python 3 is installed, try running `make` again in the RedisGraph directory:

```bash
cd ~/RedisGraph
make
```

### 5. Run `make setup` if Necessary
If the `make` command still complains or if you specifically need to run `make setup` (which the error suggests does not exist), you might be missing some steps or the repository might be outdated or corrupted. Ensure that you have the latest version of the RedisGraph repository. You can clone it using:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph.git
cd RedisGraph
make setup
make
```

### 6. Additional Dependencies
If there are other missing dependencies or setup issues, the output from the make command will usually give you a clear indication of what is missing. For RedisGraph, you may also need to install additional dependencies like Redis server and other libraries which are generally handled by the `make setup` command.

### 7. Confirm RedisGraph Module is Ready
After compiling, load the module into Redis to confirm it's ready for use:

```bash
redis-server --loadmodule ./src/redisgraph.so
```

This command starts the Redis server and loads the RedisGraph module, indicating if everything is set up correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the Python interpreter issue and successfully compile the RedisGraph module on Ubuntu 20.04. If you encounter further issues, checking the official [RedisGraph GitHub repository](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph) or their community channels for specific setup instructions might be helpful.
