# The Book of PPN
---

Based on the process of evolving from initial deployments to a robust "PPN" solution, we can infer some general steps and considerations that mirror what such a transition might entail:

1. **Initial Setup and Experimentation**: Starting with basic PostgreSQL database setups, exploring schema designs, and understanding how data can be structured to support the desired application functionality.

2. **Introduction of PostgREST**: Integrating PostgREST into the stack to automatically generate RESTful APIs from the PostgreSQL schema. This step likely involved configuring PostgREST to connect to the PostgreSQL database and fine-tuning the schema to ensure the APIs provide the needed functionality.

3. **Iterative Development**: Through git commits, one could observe an iterative process of enhancing the database schema, refining API endpoints, and improving security and performance based on testing and user feedback.

4. **Security Enhancements**: Adding security features, such as row-level security in PostgreSQL and configuring PostgREST for secure access to the APIs. Commits would include changes to database roles, permissions, and potentially the introduction of JWT for authentication.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizations to both PostgreSQL for query performance and PostgREST settings for handling concurrent requests efficiently. This might include index creation, query refinement, and PostgREST server tuning.

6. **Nginx Integration**: The introduction of Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle SSL/TLS encryption, load balancing, and static content delivery. Configurations for Nginx would be part of the commit history, detailing the setup for forwarding requests to PostgREST and handling HTTPS.

7. **Documentation and Maintenance**: Commits reflecting updates to documentation for API users, system maintenance scripts, and upgrades to PostgreSQL, PostgREST, and Nginx to newer versions for security and performance improvements.

8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integration of CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of changes to the database schema, PostgREST configuration, and Nginx settings. This includes the setup of testing frameworks and deployment scripts.

While I can't provide a direct look at the git commit history, this progression outlines a typical pathway from initial concept through to a mature deployment of a solution leveraging PostgreSQL, PostgREST, and Nginx, reflecting on key development milestones and technological integrations.
