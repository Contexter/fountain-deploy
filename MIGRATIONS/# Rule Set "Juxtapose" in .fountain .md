To create a text representation juxtaposing original and modernized dialogues using the .fountain screenplay format, follow this concise rule set:

**Character Names:** Use the same character name for both original and modernized dialogues, indicating the speaker. Do not alter or modernize character names to preserve their unique identities.

**Original Dialogue:** Write the original dialogue first, directly under the character's name. This maintains the traditional screenplay format and respects the original text's integrity.

**Modernized Dialogue Indicator:** Directly follow the original dialogue with the modernized version. Use the same character name for the modernized dialogue.

**Simultaneous Dialogue Symbol (^):** Append the ^ symbol to the character name for the modernized dialogue, indicating that it is to be read or considered simultaneously with the original dialogue. This symbol is placed immediately next to the character name without any space.

**Consistency:** Maintain this format throughout the document for each piece of dialogue you wish to juxtapose. This consistent use of character names and the simultaneous dialogue symbol ensures clarity and ease of reading.

**Clear Segmentation:** Though the .fountain format is primarily designed for screenplay writing, this adaptation of its rules allows for an educational or analytical comparison between texts. Ensure each segment of dialogue is clearly segmented for easy comparison.

By adhering to these rules, you can effectively juxtapose original and modernized dialogues in a text, using the .fountain format as a foundation for presentation. This method highlights the differences and similarities between Shakespearean language and its modern adaptation, facilitating an in-depth study or appreciation of the text.
