 This paper describes a hypothetical approach based on how MIDI events are generally constructed and how MIDIKit handles MIDI messages. This example will focus on the conceptual steps necessary to create and use a custom Meta Event within the MIDIKit framework, even though MIDIKit is primarily designed for Swift and might not directly expose MIDI 2.0-specific features yet.

### Hypothetical Example: Constructing a Custom MIDI 2.0 Meta Event with MIDIKit

#### Step 1: Define the Custom Meta Event
First, determine the purpose of your custom Meta Event and its required data structure. For this example, let's say we're creating a Meta Event to embed screenplay scene information in a MIDI file.

- **Event Type**: Custom Scene Meta Event
- **Purpose**: To store scene descriptions within a MIDI sequence.
- **Data Structure**: `(sceneNumber: Int, description: String)`

#### Step 2: Encode the Custom Meta Event Data
Meta Events in MIDI are generally structured with a starting byte of `0xFF`, followed by a type byte, length byte(s), and the event data. In MIDI 2.0 and MIDIKit, handling complex data might leverage UMP (Universal MIDI Packet) for more efficient processing, but the conceptual approach remains similar.

For simplicity, let's focus on constructing the data as if for a traditional SysEx or Meta Event message:

```swift
import MIDIKit

func encodeCustomSceneMetaEvent(sceneNumber: Int, description: String) -> [UInt8] {
    let eventType: UInt8 = 0xFF // Meta Event Start
    let customType: UInt8 = 0x7F // Hypothetical custom event type, usually reserved for sequencer-specific metadata
    let sceneNumberBytes = withUnsafeBytes(of: sceneNumber.bigEndian, Array.init)
    let descriptionBytes = Array(description.utf8)
    let length: UInt8 = UInt8(sceneNumberBytes.count + descriptionBytes.count)
    
    return [eventType, customType, length] + sceneNumberBytes + descriptionBytes
}
```

#### Step 3: Send the Custom Meta Event
Assuming you have a MIDI output set up in MIDIKit, you would then send this custom event as part of a MIDI message or packet. Given the evolving support for MIDI 2.0 in various libraries, including sending UMP messages might require adapting to the specific capabilities of the library and the MIDI 2.0 specification details.

```swift
func sendCustomSceneMetaEvent(output: MIDIOutput, sceneNumber: Int, description: String) {
    let customEventBytes = encodeCustomSceneMetaEvent(sceneNumber: sceneNumber, description: description)
    
    // Construct and send a SysEx or UMP message using MIDIKit's capabilities
    // This step is conceptual and depends on MIDIKit's support for custom SysEx or MIDI 2.0 messages
    let midiEvent = MIDIEvent.systemExclusive7(rawBytes: customEventBytes)
    try? output.send(events: [midiEvent])
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement Handling for the Custom Meta Event
On the receiving end, you would need logic to parse and interpret these custom Meta Events within the MIDI sequence, extracting the scene information for use.

### Conclusion
This example provides a conceptual framework for encoding and sending custom Meta Events with MIDIKit. Actual implementation details, especially for MIDI 2.0-specific features like UMP, will depend on the current and future capabilities of the MIDIKit library and the MIDI 2.0 specification. As libraries and the MIDI ecosystem evolve to fully embrace MIDI 2.0, more direct support for advanced features will likely become available, simplifying the process of working with custom data and events.
