# Iterative development

Iterative development is a core principle in software engineering, emphasizing gradual improvement through repeated cycles of testing, feedback, and enhancements. When applying this principle to integrating PostgreSQL with PostgREST, the focus is on refining the database schema, enhancing API endpoints, and bolstering security and performance. This process is vital to ensuring that the system remains robust, efficient, and secure over time. Here's an extensive look into how PostgreSQL data can be optimized to work effectively with PostgREST, including examples:

### Enhancing the Database Schema

Iteratively improving the database schema involves refining tables, views, and relationships to better serve the API's needs. This could mean adding new tables or columns to capture additional data, adjusting data types for efficiency, or redesigning relationships to ensure data integrity.

**Example: Adding an Index for Performance**
Suppose you have a `Character` table with many rows, and your application frequently queries characters by `script_id`. Adding an index on `script_id` could significantly improve query performance:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_character_script_id ON character(script_id);
```

### Refining API Endpoints

PostgREST automatically generates API endpoints based on your PostgreSQL schema. Iterative development might involve creating or modifying views to tailor the endpoints to your application's requirements, such as simplifying complex joins or aggregations.

**Example: Creating a View for a Custom Endpoint**
If you want an endpoint that lists scripts along with the number of characters in each script, you could create a view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW scripts_with_character_count AS
SELECT script.id, script.title, COUNT(character.id) AS character_count
FROM script
JOIN character ON script.id = character.script_id
GROUP BY script.id;
```

Now, PostgREST can serve an endpoint for this view, providing a list of scripts with their associated character counts.

### Improving Security

Security enhancements might involve tightening access controls, implementing row-level security (RLS) policies, or encrypting sensitive data. PostgreSQL and PostgREST support robust security mechanisms that can be iteratively applied and refined.

**Example: Implementing Row-Level Security**
To ensure that users can only access characters they have created:

```sql
ALTER TABLE character ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY character_access_policy ON character
USING (user_id = current_user_id());
```

This policy restricts row access in the `character` table to rows where the `user_id` matches the ID of the currently authenticated user (assuming `current_user_id()` is a function that retrieves the user's ID).

### Performance Optimization

Performance can be improved by optimizing queries, adjusting PostgREST server settings, or redesigning the schema for more efficient data access.

**Example: Optimizing a Query with a Materialized View**
For complex queries that aggregate data across multiple tables and are accessed frequently but rarely change, a materialized view can improve response times:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW script_summary AS
SELECT script.id, script.title, COUNT(distinct character.id) AS characters, COUNT(distinct dialogue.id) AS dialogues
FROM script
JOIN character ON script.id = character.script_id
JOIN dialogue ON character.id = dialogue.character_id
GROUP BY script.id;
```

### Iterative Development in Action

The iterative development process might look something like this:

1. **Initial Deployment**: Deploy the first version of your schema and PostgREST API.
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Use tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL or logging in PostgREST to identify slow queries or endpoints.
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from API consumers about missing features, usability issues, or data access needs.
4. **Implement Changes**: Based on feedback and performance analysis, make changes to the schema, add indexes, introduce or modify views, implement or adjust RLS policies, and so on.
5. **Rinse and Repeat**: Continue this cycle of monitoring, feedback, and adjustment to refine the system.

Iterative development ensures that your PostgreSQL database and PostgREST API evolve to meet the needs of your users effectively while maintaining high performance and robust security.
