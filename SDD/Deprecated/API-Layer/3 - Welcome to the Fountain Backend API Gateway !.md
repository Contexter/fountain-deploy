# Performing Cascading Management 

Considering the problems faced when walking the Foreign Key contrained path, let's consider no changes in the micro services - here is a description of  the implementation of an API Gateway that performs cascading management:

Implementing an API Gateway that performs cascading management of script-related data in a microservices architecture, without altering the underlying microservices, involves creating a layer that abstracts the complexity of interactions among various services. This layer will manage operations on the `Script`, `Act`, `Scene`, `Action`, `Character`, `Parenthetical`, `Dialogue`, and `Transition` tables in a coordinated manner, ensuring that actions affecting one service cascade through to related services as appropriate. Here's a comprehensive strategy for this implementation:

### 1. API Gateway Design and Functionality

- **Centralized Entry Point**: The API Gateway serves as the sole entry point for external requests, directing them to the appropriate microservices and handling responses back to the client. This simplifies client interaction with the backend.
- **Operation Aggregation**: The Gateway aggregates operations that span multiple microservices. For instance, creating a script involves not just entering data into the `Script` table but also potentially creating initial acts, scenes, or characters associated with it.
- **Cascading Deletes and Updates**: When a delete or update operation requires cascading effects (e.g., deleting a script should remove its related acts, scenes, etc.), the Gateway orchestrates these operations across the relevant microservices in the correct order to maintain data integrity.

### 2. Implementation Steps

#### Setup and Routing

- Define routes in the API Gateway for operations related to scripts and their components. Each route corresponds to an operation like creating, updating, or deleting scripts, acts, scenes, etc.
- Implement service discovery or predefined service endpoints within the Gateway to route requests to the correct microservice.

#### Aggregation and Orchestration

- For create operations that involve multiple tables, the Gateway sends requests to the appropriate microservices in sequence. For example, creating a script might automatically create default acts or scenes. The Gateway ensures that these operations are performed in logical order (e.g., you cannot create a scene without first having an act).
- For update operations, the Gateway forwards requests to relevant services. If an update in one service necessitates updates in others (e.g., changing a script title might require updates in metadata), the Gateway manages this process.

#### Cascading Deletes

- Implement logic in the Gateway for cascading deletes. When a request is received to delete a script, the Gateway first calls the microservice managing the `Script` table to delete the record.
- After confirming deletion, it proceeds to orchestrate deletions in related tables (e.g., `Act`, `Scene`, etc.), ensuring that all dependent records are also removed. This might involve multiple API calls to different microservices, which the Gateway handles transparently.

#### Handling Failures

- Implement robust error handling and transaction management. If any part of a multi-step operation fails, the Gateway should either roll back completed steps (if possible) or compensate for the failure by executing compensatory actions.
- Use circuit breakers and retries to manage temporary service unavailability or failures.

### 3. Additional Considerations

- **Security and Authentication**: The API Gateway should also handle authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can perform operations, especially for sensitive actions like updates and deletions.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring at the Gateway level to track operations across services, facilitating debugging and performance monitoring.
- **Rate Limiting and Quotas**: To prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage, the Gateway can implement rate limiting and enforce quotas on the number of requests that a client can make.

By abstracting complex interactions and dependencies into an API Gateway layer, you maintain the microservices architecture's benefits while providing a simplified interface for managing scripts and their related entities. This approach ensures data consistency and integrity across services without requiring direct coupling or changes to the microservices themselves.
