# Comparing the current .fountain backend with a Standard MIDI File (SMF) container...

 especially in the context of handling "time," reveals significant differences in purpose, structure, and capabilities of the two formats. Here's a detailed comparison:

### .fountain Backend
- **Purpose**: The .fountain backend is designed to store, manage, and serve screenplay content written in the Fountain format, a plain text markup language for screenwriting.
- **Structure**: Fountain files are essentially text files that use specific syntax to denote screenplay elements such as scene headers, action, dialogue, transitions, and more. The backend likely involves a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing screenplay data, with additional metadata and relationships between screenplay elements.
- **Handling Time**: In the context of a screenplay, "time" primarily refers to narrative time â€” the sequence and duration of scenes and actions within the story. The Fountain format and its backend do not inherently manage real-time or playback time but rather the logical progression of a screenplay's narrative.

### Standard MIDI File (SMF) Container
- **Purpose**: SMFs are designed to store musical sequences, including notes, tempo changes, control messages, and other MIDI events, for playback on MIDI-compatible devices and software.
- **Structure**: An SMF consists of one or more tracks containing a series of time-stamped MIDI events, organized in a binary file format. These events can include musical notes, tempo changes, and text events, among others.
- **Handling Time**: SMFs are intrinsically time-based, with each event in the file associated with a specific timestamp or delta time (time since the last event). This allows for precise synchronization of musical events during playback. Time in SMFs is typically measured in ticks per quarter note, with the actual playback time determined by the tempo (beats per minute).

### Key Differences in Context of "Time"
- **Nature of Time**: The .fountain backend deals with narrative time, which is qualitative and related to the story's progression. In contrast, SMFs handle quantifiable, precise time measurements crucial for synchronizing musical events.
- **Time Representation**: In Fountain, time might be implied through scene descriptions and dialogue. SMFs, however, explicitly encode time as part of the file structure, affecting playback and synchronization.
- **Use Cases**: The .fountain backend supports the creative process of writing and structuring screenplays, where the flow of time is subject to the narrative's needs. SMFs are used in music production, playback, and situations requiring precise timing and synchronization of events.

### Conclusion
The current .fountain backend and SMF containers serve distinct purposes and handle the concept of "time" in fundamentally different ways. The .fountain backend focuses on narrative structure and progression, while SMFs are concerned with the precise timing of musical events for playback. Comparing them highlights the unique capabilities and applications of each format, underscoring the importance of choosing the right tool and format for specific creative and technical needs.
