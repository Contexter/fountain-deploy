# Nginx Integration

Integrating Nginx as a reverse proxy within the PPN (PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Nginx) stack, particularly for applications like "The Fountain Array," significantly enhances security, performance, and scalability. Let's break down the concept of a reverse proxy, its distinction from a client or an API client library, and how Certbot with Let's Encrypt simplifies SSL/TLS encryption.

### General Functioning of a Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy sits between clients (e.g., browsers, applications) and servers, intercepting requests from clients to servers and responses from servers to clients. Unlike a forward proxy, which serves the client's interests by hiding the client's identity from the server, a reverse proxy serves the server's interests by managing incoming requests. Key functionalities include:

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers, improving response times and application availability.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Acts as the termination point for SSL/TLS connections, decrypting incoming requests and encrypting server responses, thereby securing data in transit.
- **Caching Static Content**: Stores copies of static content (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript files), reducing the load on the application server and improving response times for subsequent requests.
- **Compression**: Compresses server responses before sending them to the client, reducing bandwidth usage and improving load times.

### Why It Is Not a Client or Uses a Fountain API Client Library

A reverse proxy is not considered a client in the traditional sense because it does not initiate requests out of its own needs or interact with APIs based on business logic. Instead, it acts on behalf of other clients, managing and optimizing their requests to the server. It doesn't use API client libraries, as its primary role is to forward requests rather than understand or manipulate the API's business logic. The reverse proxy operates at the HTTP layer, handling incoming requests without needing knowledge of the application's internal workings or the specifics of the Fountain API.

### Simplifying SSL/TLS with Certbot and Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA) that provides an easy way to obtain and install SSL/TLS certificates, enhancing the security of web applications. Certbot is a client tool that automates the process of obtaining and renewing certificates from Let's Encrypt and configuring web servers to use these certificates.

- **Easy Setup**: With Certbot, setting up HTTPS for an Nginx server is straightforward. Certbot can automatically configure Nginx to use the obtained SSL/TLS certificates, enabling secure HTTPS connections with minimal manual intervention.
- **Automatic Renewal**: Certbot can be scheduled to automatically renew certificates before they expire, ensuring uninterrupted HTTPS service.
- **Free and Secure**: Let's Encrypt and Certbot offer a cost-effective solution for implementing HTTPS, making secure connections accessible to a wider range of applications without additional financial burden.

### Example: Configuring Nginx with Certbot for The Fountain Array

1. **Install Certbot**:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```

2. **Obtain and Install a Certificate**:
   ```
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
   ```
   Follow the interactive prompts to complete the process. Certbot will modify the Nginx configuration to use the newly obtained certificates.

3. **Automatic Renewal Check**:
   ```
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```
   This command tests the automatic renewal process to ensure it works correctly.

Integrating Nginx as a reverse proxy and utilizing Certbot with Let's Encrypt for SSL/TLS encryption not only secures the application but also optimizes its performance and scalability, making it a critical component of the PPN stack for applications like "The Fountain Array."

## NGINX serving PostgREST API endpoints

When Nginx serves PostgREST API endpoints, especially in a setup where the gateway (Nginx) may reside on the same machine as the PostgreSQL database, it acts as a powerful reverse proxy and HTTP server. This setup is particularly efficient for managing a large number of API endpoints, as it can handle high volumes of concurrent connections, provide SSL/TLS encryption, and distribute loads effectively. Focusing on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, here's how you can configure Nginx to serve PostgREST API endpoints and manage them efficiently:

### Step 1: Install Nginx

On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, installing Nginx is straightforward:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

Once installed, Nginx starts automatically. You can check its status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### Step 2: Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy for PostgREST

Create a new Nginx server block configuration file within `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`. This file will define how Nginx should handle requests to your PostgREST API endpoints.

1. **Create the Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/postgrest
   ```

2. **Configure the Server Block**:
   Add the following configuration, adjusting `server_name` to your domain or IP address, and `proxy_pass` to the address where PostgREST is running (typically `localhost` with the port PostgREST listens on, e.g., 3000):
   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```
   This configuration tells Nginx to listen for HTTP requests and forward them to the PostgREST instance running on `localhost:3000`. It also forwards necessary headers to ensure PostgREST can understand the original request context.

3. **Enable the Configuration**:
   Link your configuration file from `sites-available` to `sites-enabled` to activate it:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/postgrest /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

4. **Test and Reload Nginx**:
   Test the configuration for syntax errors:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```
   If everything is correct, reload Nginx to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### Step 3: Handling High Volumes of API Endpoints

Nginx excels at managing high volumes of connections, making it an ideal front for PostgREST APIs, particularly when:

- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for static content or infrequently changed data to reduce the load on PostgREST.
- **Connection Pooling**: Use tools like PgBouncer in conjunction with PostgREST to manage PostgreSQL connections efficiently.
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure Nginx to limit the rate of requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage among consumers.
- **Load Balancing**: If you scale your PostgREST instances horizontally, Nginx can distribute incoming requests across multiple instances, enhancing the system's overall capacity to handle requests.

### SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt

Secure your API by setting up SSL/TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt:

1. **Install Certbot**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```

2. **Obtain and Install Certificates**:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
   ```
   Follow the prompts to secure your domain. Certbot will automatically adjust the Nginx configuration to use HTTPS.

By following these steps, Nginx can efficiently serve as the gateway to your PostgREST API endpoints on an Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) server, providing a robust, secure, and scalable environment for your API consumers.
