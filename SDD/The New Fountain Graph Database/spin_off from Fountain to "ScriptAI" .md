Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide to setting up a full-stack application using Vapor, Redis, RedisAI, and CouchDB from source on an Ubuntu 20.04 VPS. This guide avoids package managers like `apt` for installation and focuses on building from source where possible.

## System Setup Overview: ScriptAI

### ScriptAI: A Collaborative Scriptwriting Platform

**ScriptAI** leverages advanced AI functionalities to assist scriptwriters in enhancing their creative processes. By integrating predictive text generation, sentiment analysis, and real-time collaborative editing powered by RedisAI, ScriptAI transforms traditional scriptwriting into a dynamic and interactive experience.

### Technologies

1. **Vapor**: A robust web framework for Swift, ideal for building scalable applications.
2. **Redis**: Fast, in-memory data store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
3. **RedisAI**: Redis module facilitating efficient machine learning model serving.
4. **CouchDB**: Scalable NoSQL document database that uses JSON for documents.

## Installation Guide: Building from Source on Ubuntu 20.04

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install general dependencies necessary for building the components:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential curl git wget pkg-config unzip autoconf libtool python3
```

### 2. Install Swift

Download and compile Swift from source:

```bash
wget https://download.swift.org/swift-5.3.3-release/ubuntu2004/swift-5.3.3-RELEASE/swift-5.3.3-RELEASE.tar.gz
tar xzf swift-5.3.3-RELEASE.tar.gz
cd swift-5.3.3-RELEASE
./utils/build-script --release-debuginfo
export PATH="$(pwd)/build/Ninja-ReleaseAssert/swift-linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH"
```

### 3. Install Redis

Clone the Redis repository and compile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redis/redis.git
cd redis
make
sudo make install
```

### 4. Install RedisAI

Clone the RedisAI repository and its submodules, then build:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI.git
cd RedisAI
make setup
make build
sudo make install
```

Add the RedisAI module to Redis configuration:

```bash
echo "loadmodule $(pwd)/install-cpu/redisai.so" >> redis.conf
```

### 5. Install CouchDB

CouchDB dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y pkg-config libmozjs-68-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Clone and build CouchDB:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/couchdb.git
cd couchdb
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### 6. Configure and Run Services

#### Running Redis

Start Redis server with RedisAI:

```bash
redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
```

#### Running CouchDB

Configure local.ini as needed, then start CouchDB:

```bash
cd /path/to/couchdb
./bin/couchdb
```

### 7. Set Up Vapor Application

Create a new Vapor project and add dependencies:

```bash
vapor new ScriptAI
cd ScriptAI
echo 'import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "ScriptAI",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git", from: "4.0.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/redis.git", from: "4.0.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/couchdb-kit.git", from: "4.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "App", dependencies: [
            .product(name: "Vapor", package: "vapor"),
            .product(name: "Redis", package: "redis"),
            .product(name: "CouchDBKit", package: "couchdb-kit")
        ]),
    ]
)' > Package.swift
```

Run the Vapor project:

```bash
vapor build
vapor run
```

### Conclusion

This setup defines a high-performance, AI-enhanced scriptwriting platform named **ScriptAI**, which utilizes the full potential of a modern application stack with Vapor, Redis, RedisAI, and CouchDB. This configuration not only promises excellent performance due to its in-memory computations but also offers advanced AI features, making it a cutting-edge solution for collaborative environments.
