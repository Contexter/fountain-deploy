#Fountain FastAPI Proxies using generated code

To create a cross-schema microservice FastAPI implementation using a Swagger-generated Python client code for the fountain backend, we'll first outline the steps and then provide a code example that encapsulates the essence of such an implementation. This example will integrate various operations across schemas within the fountain backend, focusing on operations that might include fetching, posting, updating, and deleting resources across `scripts`, `playwrights`, `characters`, `dialogues`, `actions`, and `scenes`. Given the constraint of a maximum of 30 operations, we'll ensure a balanced representation of functionalities.

### Steps for Implementation:

1. **Generate Python Client Code**: Use Swagger Codegen or OpenAPI Generator to create a Python client library from the `https://api-script.fountain.coach.json` Swagger documentation.

2. **FastAPI Application Setup**: Initialize a FastAPI application that will serve as the gateway for the cross-schema operations.

3. **Dependency Injection**: Inject the generated Python client as a dependency into FastAPI routes to facilitate API calls to the fountain backend.

4. **Operations Mapping**: Map FastAPI endpoints to corresponding operations in the generated Python client, ensuring a mix of CRUD operations across different schemas.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage responses from the fountain backend gracefully.

6. **Response Formatting**: Format the responses from the backend before sending them to the client to ensure consistency and readability.

7. **Security and Authentication**: Incorporate security measures as needed, based on the backend requirements.

### Example Code Overview:

For demonstration, let's assume the generated Python client has a structure with classes named after schemas (`ScriptClient`, `PlaywrightClient`, etc.) and methods corresponding to operations (`get_scripts`, `post_script`, `delete_script`, etc.).

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from generated_client import ScriptClient, PlaywrightClient, CharacterClient  # Hypothetical imports

app = FastAPI()

# Dependency injection of the client
def get_script_client():
    return ScriptClient()

def get_playwright_client():
    return PlaywrightClient()

def get_character_client():
    return CharacterClient()

# Example operations
@app.get("/scripts/{script_id}")
async def read_script(script_id: int, client: ScriptClient = Depends(get_script_client)):
    try:
        script = client.get_script(script_id=script_id)
        return script
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Script not found")

@app.post("/scripts/")
async def create_script(script_data: dict, client: ScriptClient = Depends(get_script_client)):
    try:
        script = client.post_script(script_data=script_data)
        return script
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Error creating script")

# This pattern can be repeated for different operations across schemas,
# ensuring a mix of CRUD operations within the 30 operations limit.

# Additional operations would similarly define FastAPI endpoints that utilize
# the injected clients to interact with the fountain backend.
```

This example demonstrates the foundational structure for integrating the Swagger-generated Python client code for the fountain backend into a FastAPI application, focusing on cross-schema operations. Remember, the actual implementation details, such as the methods and parameters of the generated client, will depend on the specifics of the Swagger documentation for the fountain backend.
