Extending the concept to cover all tables involved in the API Gateway, we would expand the `ServiceManager` class to include methods for managing `Act`, `Scene`, `Action`, `Character`, `Parenthetical`, `Dialogue`, and `Transition` entities. This comprehensive approach ensures the API Gateway can orchestrate CRUD operations across all aspects of the scriptwriting and production process, maintaining a clean separation of concerns between the FastAPI application and the microservices it interacts with.

### Expanded ServiceManager Class

The `ServiceManager` class is extended with additional methods for each entity type. Here's an outline of how it might look:

```python
class ServiceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define base URLs for each microservice
        self.script_service_url = "http://script-service"
        self.act_service_url = "http://act-service"
        self.scene_service_url = "http://scene-service"
        # Additional services
        self.character_service_url = "http://character-service"
        self.dialogue_service_url = "http://dialogue-service"
        self.action_service_url = "http://action-service"
        # More services as needed

    # Script operations
    async def create_script(self, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    async def delete_script_and_related_entities(self, script_id: int) -> dict:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    # Act operations
    async def create_act(self, script_id: int, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    # Scene operations
    async def create_scene(self, act_id: int, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    # Character operations
    async def create_character(self, script_id: int, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    # Dialogue operations
    async def create_dialogue(self, scene_id: int, character_id: int, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    # Action operations
    async def create_action(self, scene_id: int, character_id: int, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    # Additional methods for updating, deleting, and retrieving for each entity...
```

### FastAPI Application Integration

The FastAPI application would then define routes that utilize these methods, providing a comprehensive API for managing all aspects of scripts and productions:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from models import ScriptData, ActData, SceneData, CharacterData, DialogueData, ActionData
# Assume models.py defines Pydantic models for each entity's data

app = FastAPI()
service_manager = ServiceManager()

# Script routes
@app.post("/scripts/")
async def create_script_endpoint(script_data: ScriptData):
    # Use service_manager to create a script
    pass

# Act routes
@app.post("/acts/")
async def create_act_endpoint(act_data: ActData):
    # Use service_manager to create an act
    pass

# Scene routes
@app.post("/scenes/")
async def create_scene_endpoint(scene_data: SceneData):
    # Use service_manager to create a scene
    pass

# Character routes
@app.post("/characters/")
async def create_character_endpoint(character_data: CharacterData):
    # Use service_manager to create a character
    pass

# Dialogue routes
@app.post("/dialogues/")
async def create_dialogue_endpoint(dialogue_data: DialogueData):
    # Use service_manager to create a dialogue
    pass

# Action routes
@app.post("/actions/")
async def create_action_endpoint(action_data: ActionData):
    # Use service_manager to create an action
    pass

# More routes for updating, deleting, and retrieving entities...
```

This design provides a unified interface for managing a complex script and production data structure, encapsulating the logic of communicating with various microservices within the `ServiceManager`. By doing so, the FastAPI application remains clean, focused, and easier to maintain, while still offering a full-featured API to clients.

# The class diagram of this API Gateway

To illustrate the extended API Gateway concept that manages a complex scriptwriting and production database, including tables for `Script`, `Act`, `Scene`, `Action`, `Character`, `Parenthetical`, `Dialogue`, and `Transition`, here's a conceptual class diagram. This diagram focuses on the `ServiceManager` class within the FastAPI application, detailing its relationships with the various entity management functions and external microservices.

### Description of the Diagram Components:

- **FastAPI App**: The main application framework that defines the web service.

- **ServiceManager**: A class that encapsulates the logic for interacting with various microservices responsible for different aspects of script and production management.

- **Models**: Represents the data structures used for interacting with the API, such as `ScriptData`, `ActData`, etc. These models define the expected structure of requests and responses.

- **ScriptService, ActService, SceneService, CharacterService...**: External microservices (not part of the FastAPI application) that the `ServiceManager` communicates with to perform CRUD operations on the respective entities.

### Relationships:

- The **FastAPI App** utilizes the `ServiceManager` to abstract the complexity of operations across various entities and microservices.
- The **ServiceManager** uses **Models** for data validation and structuring when calling microservices.
- For each entity operation (`create_...`, `delete_...`, `update_...`, `get_...`), the **ServiceManager** calls the corresponding **Service** (`ScriptService`, `ActService`, etc.) to execute the operation.

### Operations:

- Operations like `create_script`, `delete_script`, `create_act`, `create_scene`, etc., in the `ServiceManager` represent the API Gateway's capabilities to manage entities across different microservices.

This class diagram illustrates the architectural setup of the API Gateway, emphasizing the central role of the `ServiceManager` in orchestrating interactions with a suite of microservices for comprehensive script and production management.
