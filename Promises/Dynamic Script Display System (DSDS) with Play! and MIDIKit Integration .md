# Dynamic Script Display System (DSDS) with Play! and MIDIKit Integration 

## Project Pitch

#### Overview
The Dynamic Script Display System (DSDS), in collaboration with the play! initiative, ushers in a new era of interactive scriptwriting and storytelling. This innovative project leverages the MIDIKit library to harness the power of MIDI 2.0, facilitating a seamless, real-time visualization of scripts updated during play! sessions. At the heart of this integration is play!, acting as a mediator and orchestrator, ensuring that every action within a session translates into dynamic script modifications. This project sets the stage for a fusion of narrative creativity and musical expression, powered by a robust Fountain backend.

#### Objectives
- **Enhanced Real-Time Collaboration**: Empower scriptwriters and composers to see their changes reflected immediately in a shared viewer, fostering a highly collaborative and creative environment.
- **Leveraging MIDI 2.0**: Implement MIDI 2.0's sophisticated features for detailed control over script elements and musical integration, offering unparalleled expressiveness.
- **play! as the Mediator**: Position play! as the central hub for session actions, mediating between user inputs, the Fountain backend, and the MIDIKit-enabled frontend.

#### Detailed Implementation Plan

##### 1. **Fountain Backend Integration**
- **Structure and API**: Develop a comprehensive backend system based on the Fountain screenplay format, capable of storing, processing, and delivering script content in real-time. This system will expose a RESTful API, meticulously defined in an OpenAPI specification, to interact with play! sessions.
- **play! Session Interaction**: play! will interact directly with the Fountain backend, sending API calls triggered by user actions. Each action, from dialogue addition to scene transitions, corresponds to specific API endpoints, ensuring direct updates to the script data.

##### 2. **MIDIKit and MIDI 2.0 Implementation**
- **Channel Mapping for Script Actions**: Define a unique MIDI channel for different types of script updates, using MIDIKit to send and receive MIDI messages that correspond to play! session actions.
- **Complex Data Handling**: Utilize MIDIKit's SysEx message capabilities to transmit complex script updates, encoding data such as character details or scene descriptions into serialized formats.

##### 3. **Real-time Viewer Updates**
- **Bidirectional MIDI Communication**: Implement a system where the Fountain backend and the viewer communicate bidirectionally via MIDIKit, enabling not only the update of script views in real time but also the potential for viewer-originated actions to influence the play! session.
- **Security and Data Integrity**: Apply rigorous security measures to protect the integrity of transmitted MIDI data, ensuring that all communication is validated and sanitized to prevent malicious interference.

##### 4. **play! as the Central Mediator**
- **Session Management**: play! will manage the lifecycle of scriptwriting sessions, from initiation to completion, coordinating between the Fountain backend and the MIDIKit-enabled frontend. This involves translating session actions into API calls and MIDI messages, as well as managing session state and user interactions.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: By acting as the mediator, play! ensures a fluid and intuitive user experience, where scriptwriters and composers can focus on creativity without worrying about the underlying technical complexities.

##### 5. **Integration with Web and Native Applications**
- **Web MIDI API and WebSocket**: For web components, integrate MIDIKit functionalities with the Web MIDI API, using WebSocket for real-time communication between the server and web clients.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure the system is accessible across various platforms, with native application support for iOS and web interfaces for broader accessibility, leveraging play! and MIDIKit's capabilities to the fullest.

#### Project Pitch
The DSDS, augmented by the play! project and MIDIKit, represents a visionary step forward in the domain of digital storytelling. By intertwining MIDI 2.0's expressive capabilities with the structured narrative power of the Fountain format, managed by a sophisticated backend, this initiative paves the way for dynamic, collaborative storytelling experiences. play!, as the central mediator, ensures that the creative process remains seamless and intuitive, bridging the gap between narrative development and musical composition.

This ambitious project not only elevates the scriptwriting and composition process but also opens up new avenues for interactive entertainment, making it an essential tool for creators seeking to explore the frontiers of their craft in the digital age.
