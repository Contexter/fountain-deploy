... cloning the `fountain-deploy` GitHub repository, creating scripts within its `openAPI` directory, and committing the changes with an expressive messageâ€”follow these steps divided into sections for clarity. Note that these instructions are designed for execution on a Unix-like environment (e.g., Ubuntu, macOS) with Git installed.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the `fountain-deploy` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Contexter/fountain-deploy.git
cd fountain-deploy
```

### Create the Installation Script in the `openAPI` Directory

Navigate to the `openAPI` directory and create the installation script there:

```bash
cd openAPI
```

Create the installation script `install_swagger_tools.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure running from the openAPI directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Update and install necessary packages
echo "Updating package lists..."
sudo apt-get update

echo "Installing jq..."
sudo apt-get install -y jq

echo "Installing Node.js and npm..."
# Using NodeSource's binary distributions for a more recent version of Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v

echo "Installing Swagger tools..."
# Install swagger-cli for OpenAPI operations
sudo npm install -g swagger-cli

# Install swagger-diff for comparing OpenAPI specs
sudo npm install -g swagger-diff

echo "All tools installed successfully."
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x install_swagger_tools.sh
```

### Commit the Script to the Repository

After creating and testing the script to ensure it works as expected, commit it to the repository:

1. **Add the script to the repository:**

```bash
git add install_swagger_tools.sh
```

2. **Commit the changes:**

Use an expressive commit message that clearly describes the addition, for example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add script to install Swagger tools in openAPI directory"
```

3. **Push the changes to GitHub:**

Assuming you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository and want to push to the `main` branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

If you do not have direct push access to the repository, you may need to fork the repository first, push the changes to your fork, and then create a pull request against the original repository.

### Notes

- Ensure you have the required permissions to push changes to the `fountain-deploy` repository. If you're not a contributor, you might need to fork the repository and push changes to your fork, then open a pull request.
- This guide assumes you have basic familiarity with Git and GitHub workflows, including cloning repositories, creating commits, and pushing changes.
- Before running any script that installs software or modifies system settings, review the script to ensure it meets your needs and is safe to execute.
