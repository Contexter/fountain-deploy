# The Fountain - FastAPI Project Scaffold

Given the requirement for a complete project setup including directory structure and initial file scaffolding for a FastAPI application aligned with the outlined "Fountain" Backend, the following shell script meticulously constructs the entire structure. It includes model, schema, service, and API endpoint stubs for each entity, along with core configuration and foundational setup.

Please ensure you have the necessary environment to run this script, including permissions and a Unix-like shell.

```

This script  creates a complete project structure for the "Fountain" Backend FastAPI application, including SQLAlchemy models reflecting your database schema, Pydantic schemas for request and response validation, service layers for business logic, and API endpoints for interacting with each entity.

To run this script:

1. Ensure you have a suitable Unix-like environment with Bash.
2. Save the script to a file, for example, `setup_fountain_backend.sh`.
3. Make it executable with `chmod +x setup_fountain_backend.sh`.
4. Execute the script using `./setup_fountain_backend.sh`.

This will generate the entire project structure and stub files based on your detailed requirements. Adjustments may be necessary to tailor the generated code to your project's specific needs fully.

# Stubs? - What's this? 

In the context of the script and software development, a "stub" refers to a piece of code used as a placeholder for future implementation. It's essentially a skeleton method or function that's defined but not yet fully implemented. Stubs provide the basic structure of the code or a specific functionality but leave the detailed logic to be filled in later. They are useful during the early stages of development for outlining how the software architecture will look and for testing purposes, allowing the overall system to compile and run without the final implementation in place.

In the provided script, stubs for SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas, service layers, and API endpoints are created for each entity defined in the "Fountain" Backend project. These stubs include the basic method signatures and class definitions based on the database schema and FastAPI's requirements for models and endpoints but without detailed business logic or data manipulation. This setup allows developers to quickly scaffold a project structure, defining where and how data flows through the application without initially focusing on the specifics of how each operation is performed.

### What's Next?

After generating the initial project structure and stubs with the script, the next steps involve progressively fleshing out these stubs into fully functional components of your FastAPI application. Here's a guideline on what to do next:

1. **Model Completion**: Start by completing the SQLAlchemy model definitions. Add all necessary columns for each table, define relationships between tables (e.g., `ForeignKey` and `relationship()` in SQLAlchemy), and ensure types and constraints match your database schema.

2. **Schema Definitions**: Refine your Pydantic schemas to accurately represent the data your API will accept and return. This may involve defining additional fields, setting validation rules, and creating schemas for different use cases (e.g., creation vs. update).

3. **Service Layer Logic**: Implement the business logic within your service layer. This involves writing the code to handle CRUD operations, data processing, and any other business rules specific to your application.

4. **API Endpoints**: Expand upon the stubbed API endpoints in each module under `api/endpoints`. Implement the logic for handling requests, interacting with the service layer to perform operations, and returning the appropriate responses.

5. **Testing**: Develop tests for your API endpoints, service layer, and models. FastAPI's test client, along with Pytest, can be used to write unit and integration tests ensuring your application behaves as expected.

6. **Database Integration**: Ensure your `database.py` is correctly set up to connect to your actual database. This involves configuring the database URI, creating session management, and potentially handling migrations with tools like Alembic.

7. **Dependency Management**: Review and update `requirements.txt` as necessary to match the dependencies your project actually uses, especially as you add new libraries or discover more about your project's needs.

8. **Additional Features**: Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to add authentication, permissions, background tasks, or integrate with other services and APIs.

9. **Documentation and Deployment**: Take advantage of FastAPI's automatic documentation to review and refine your API's documentation. Then, prepare your application for deployment, considering environment management, hosting options, and CI/CD pipelines.

By methodically working through these steps, you'll transform the scaffolded stubs into a comprehensive, functional backend system tailored to your project's requirements.
