Generating a public SSH key on a Mac for server login involves using the Terminal app to create a pair of key files: the public key and the private key. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - You can find the Terminal in Applications > Utilities > Terminal. Alternatively, you can use Spotlight by pressing `Cmd + Space`, typing "Terminal", and pressing `Enter`.

2. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**:
   - Before creating a new SSH key, check if you already have any existing SSH keys that you might want to use. Run:
     ```bash
     ls -al ~/.ssh
     ```
   - This lists all files in your `.ssh` directory. Look for files named something like `id_rsa.pub` (RSA) or `id_ed25519.pub` (EdDSA). If you already have a key and want to use it, you can skip the generation step.

3. **Generate a New SSH Key**:
   - If you need to create a new key, use the following command. You can use RSA or EdDSA. EdDSA (Ed25519) is recommended for better security and performance.
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
   - Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your email address. This email is used as a label for your key.
   - When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press `Enter` to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

4. **Set a Secure Passphrase**:
   - When prompted, you might want to enter a passphrase for your key for added security. This passphrase will be required every time you use the key. If you prefer not to have a passphrase, just press `Enter` for no passphrase.

5. **Ensure your SSH Agent is Running**:
   - The SSH agent manages your keys and remembers your passphrase. Start the agent and add your new key:
     ```bash
     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     ```
   - If you used a different filename or directory, replace `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` with your specific path.

6. **Copy the Public Key to your Clipboard**:
   - To use your new key, you'll need to copy the public key to your server's authorized keys:
     ```bash
     pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - This command copies the public key file contents to your clipboard. You can now paste it into your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file or wherever it is needed.

7. **Login to your Server**:
   - Once the public key is set up on the server, you can connect via SSH without a password:
     ```bash
     ssh username@server_address
     ```
   - Replace `username` with your actual username and `server_address` with the server’s IP address or hostname.

By following these steps, you will have set up a secure SSH key pair for server logins from your Mac. If you manage multiple keys or need to automate logins, consider using an SSH config file to simplify the process.

### OpenSSH

OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell) is an open-source set of network connectivity tools designed to provide secure communications over unsecured channels. It uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary.

Here are a few additional details about OpenSSH keys and the procedure:

- **Key Formats**: OpenSSH supports various key formats. The most commonly used are:
  - **RSA** (`id_rsa`): This is one of the older formats, widely supported across various systems and services.
  - **EdDSA** (`id_ed25519`): This is a newer format recommended for its better security properties and performance benefits over RSA.

- **Generating the Key**: The `ssh-keygen` command is part of the OpenSSH package. The command used to generate an EdDSA key:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```
  This command explicitly specifies using the EdDSA algorithm with the `-t ed25519` option. It generates a private key (`id_ed25519`) and a corresponding public key (`id_ed25519.pub`).

- **Secure Communication**: When you use the key generated by this method to set up an SSH session, the session is encrypted using the cryptographic key pair, ensuring that your connection is secure.

- **Key Management**: Adding the key to the `ssh-agent` with `ssh-add` simplifies using SSH keys because the agent manages the keys and can automatically provide your private key when you log in to various hosts.

- **Public Key Deployment**: Copying the public key to a server (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`) enables the key-based authentication process. This method is much more secure than password-based authentication because it is immune to brute-force password guessing attacks.

Using OpenSSH keys is a best practice for securing SSH access to remote servers, and it's supported by virtually all servers that use SSH. If you're setting up SSH keys for use with specific software or systems (like GitHub, AWS EC2), ensure you follow any additional guidelines they might have, especially concerning the key format or passphrase requirements.
