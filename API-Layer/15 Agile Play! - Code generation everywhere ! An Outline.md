
Since we started the development process of the Fountain backend with its functional definition in a bootstrap.sql script, all necessary information for a code generation process is already available. This includes entity names, fields, and their types, which obviates the need for an initial parameter acuisition and uses the information provided by the .sql directly to generate the models, schemas, services, and API routes. With full alembic integration, the expected output of running alembic migrations then becomes : what we exactly  _**input**_ ! Why is this useful? Well, let's see ...

### Step 1: Automated Parsing of Bootstrap Script

The first step in the process would involve parsing the SQL bootstrap script to extract entity definitions, including table names and column details. This automated parsing would identify each entity's name, fields, types, and any potential primary key or unique identifiers.

### Step 2: Code Generation Based on Parsed Information

Using the parsed information, the next steps would unfold as follows:

#### Models Generation

For every table defined in the bootstrap script, a corresponding SQLAlchemy model will be generated. For example, for the `Playwright` table:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Text
from database import Base

class Playwright(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'playwright'
    author_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    biography = Column(Text)
    contact_information = Column(Text)
```

#### Schemas Generation

Pydantic models for each entity will be crafted to facilitate request validation and response serialization:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class PlaywrightBase(BaseModel):
    name: str
    biography: str | None = None
    contact_information: str | None = None

class PlaywrightCreate(PlaywrightBase):
    pass

class PlaywrightInDB(PlaywrightBase):
    author_id: int

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

#### CRUD Services and API Routes

CRUD operations and API routes will be scaffolded to provide a complete set of functionalities for interacting with each entity via the API.

### Step 3: Integration and Migration Dialogue

After generating all necessary components based on the script, the integration of models into Alembic for migration purposes and the inclusion of API routes into the FastAPI app would be outlined. Finally, a dialogue concerning the execution of migrations to update the database schema would be initiated, leveraging the generated models:

- **Automatic Migration Generation**: Instructions or commands for generating migration scripts based on the new models.
- **Application of Migrations**: Guidance on applying these migrations to the database.
- **Rollback Options**: Options for rolling back migrations if needed, ensuring the database's integrity and alignment with the codebase.

This streamlined process from parsing the bootstrap script to generating a fully functional API backend embodies the agility and efficiency required in modern web development, particularly in a microservices architecture.
