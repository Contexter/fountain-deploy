To provide a more detailed, functional example based on the conceptual FastAPI implementation for an API Gateway, we'll follow the outlined steps focusing on managing scripts and related components. This will cover a simplified scenario for creating and deleting a script, including cascading deletions for related acts and scenes. 

### Prerequisites

- FastAPI installed: `pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx`
- Mock microservice endpoints are assumed to exist for the purpose of this example. In a real-world scenario, these would be replaced with actual microservice URLs and adjusted according to their APIs.

### Step 1: Setup FastAPI Application

Create a file named `gateway.py` and set up the FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()
```

### Step 2: Define Microservice Communication

Implement asynchronous functions for interacting with microservices responsible for scripts, acts, and scenes:

```python
import httpx

# Mock URLs for demonstration purposes
SCRIPT_SERVICE_URL = "http://localhost:8001"
ACT_SERVICE_URL = "http://localhost:8002"
SCENE_SERVICE_URL = "http://localhost:8003"

async def delete_script(script_id: int):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.delete(f"{SCRIPT_SERVICE_URL}/scripts/{script_id}")
        return response.json()

async def delete_acts_by_script(script_id: int):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.delete(f"{ACT_SERVICE_URL}/acts/by-script/{script_id}")
        return response.json()

async def delete_scenes_by_act(act_id: int):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.delete(f"{SCENE_SERVICE_URL}/scenes/by-act/{act_id}")
        return response.json()
```

### Step 3: Implement API Endpoints for Script Management

Add routes to the FastAPI application for managing scripts, including cascading delete operations:

```python
@app.delete("/scripts/{script_id}")
async def api_delete_script(script_id: int):
    # Delete script and related entities in a cascading manner
    script_response = await delete_script(script_id)
    if not script_response.get('success', False):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Failed to delete script.")

    acts_response = await delete_acts_by_script(script_id)
    if acts_response.get('success', False):
        for act_id in acts_response['deleted_act_ids']:
            await delete_scenes_by_act(act_id)
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Failed to delete acts.")

    return {"message": "Script and all related entities deleted successfully"}
```

### Step 4: Handle Errors and Transactions

In this simplified example, basic error handling is implemented using FastAPI's `HTTPException`. A more comprehensive implementation would include transaction-like rollback mechanisms where feasible.

### Step 5: Secure, Log, and Monitor the Application

Integrate security and monitoring according to your project's needs. For demonstration purposes, these aspects are not covered in this code snippet.

### Step 6: Running the API Gateway

To run the API Gateway, use Uvicorn from the command line:

```bash
uvicorn gateway:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI application on `localhost` with port `8000` by default. You can interact with the API using tools like cURL, Postman, or directly through the FastAPI documentation interface at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Note

Remember, the URLs and logic used here are for illustrative purposes. You'll need to adjust them to match the actual endpoints and logic of your microservices. This example also assumes synchronous deletion of acts and scenes for simplicity, but real-world scenarios might require more complex orchestration, especially for handling failures and ensuring consistency across services.

# Internalizations

To adjust the implementation so that all Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations are handled internally within the API Gateway, without exposing individual CRUD methods via FastAPI routes to the clients, we will encapsulate these operations in a class. This class will manage all interactions with microservices internally, offering a simplified interface to the FastAPI app for managing scripts and their related entities. Here, we focus on a simplified approach for script management that can be expanded for other entities.

### Step 1: Define a Service Manager Class

This class will encapsulate all CRUD operations, communicating with various microservices as needed:

```python
import httpx

class ServiceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Microservices base URLs
        self.script_service_url = "http://localhost:8001"
        self.act_service_url = "http://localhost:8002"
        self.scene_service_url = "http://localhost:8003"

    async def create_script(self, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Logic to create a script by calling the Script service
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.post(f"{self.script_service_url}/scripts", json=data)
        return response.json()

    async def delete_script_and_related_entities(self, script_id: int) -> dict:
        # Delete the script
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            await client.delete(f"{self.script_service_url}/scripts/{script_id}")
        
        # Assume deletion of related acts and scenes are handled internally by the script service
        # for simplicity. In a more complex implementation, you would call delete on acts and scenes here.
        
        return {"success": True, "message": "Script and related entities deleted"}

    # Methods for updating, and getting scripts, and managing other entities like Acts and Scenes would be added here
```

### Step 2: Integrate Service Manager with FastAPI

Now, use the `ServiceManager` class within the FastAPI application to handle requests. This abstracts away the details of which microservice is called for any given operation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()
service_manager = ServiceManager()

class ScriptData(BaseModel):
    title: str
    author: str
    # Other script fields as needed

@app.post("/scripts/")
async def create_script(script_data: ScriptData):
    result = await service_manager.create_script(script_data.dict())
    if result.get("success"):
        return {"message": "Script created successfully", "script_id": result.get("id")}
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Failed to create script.")

@app.delete("/scripts/{script_id}")
async def delete_script(script_id: int):
    result = await service_manager.delete_script_and_related_entities(script_id)
    if result.get("success"):
        return {"message": "Script and all related entities deleted successfully"}
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Failed to delete script.")
```

### Running the Application

Ensure all dependencies are installed and run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn gateway:app --reload
```

This design encapsulates the complexity of CRUD operations within the `ServiceManager` class, simplifying the FastAPI routes to only deal with client-facing operations. This approach not only hides the internal CRUD mechanisms from the router but also provides flexibility to change the underlying service interactions without affecting the FastAPI application's external API.

# A Class Diagram

Creating a class diagram for the described FastAPI implementation with a `ServiceManager` class involves outlining the relationship between the FastAPI application, the `ServiceManager` class, and how it interacts with various microservices for CRUD operations. Below is a textual representation of such a class diagram, highlighting the main components and their interactions.

### Components:

- **FastAPI App**: The main application using FastAPI. It defines the routes/endpoints that clients interact with. This app uses instances of the `ServiceManager` class to handle the logic for each route.

- **ServiceManager**: A class that encapsulates the logic for communicating with various microservices. It contains methods for creating, deleting, updating, and retrieving scripts and related entities like acts and scenes. Each method in this class makes HTTP requests to the corresponding microservice.

- **ScriptService, ActService, SceneService**: These represent external microservices responsible for handling operations related to scripts, acts, and scenes, respectively. In this design, they are not actual classes within the FastAPI application but external services that the `ServiceManager` communicates with.

### Relationships:

- The FastAPI app **uses** the `ServiceManager` to handle the logic for its routes, abstracting away the details of interacting with various microservices.
- The `ServiceManager` **communicates with** `ScriptService`, `ActService`, and `SceneService` to perform CRUD operations. This is represented by the directed associations from the `ServiceManager` to each service, indicating that the `ServiceManager` makes calls to these services.

### Operations:

- **create_script()**: Creates a new script by calling the ScriptService.
- **delete_script_and_related_entities()**: Deletes a script and its related entities (acts, scenes) through cascading calls to ActService and SceneService.
- **update_script()**: Updates a script's details by calling the ScriptService.
- **get_script()**: Retrieves script details from the ScriptService.

This class diagram is a high-level representation meant to illustrate the structure and relationships within the implementation. It abstracts away specific details like method parameters and return types for clarity.
