# Logging Monitor - A complete script to automate the GoAccess installation 

... and configuration for monitoring all the Nginx host log files specified. This script installs GoAccess, creates configuration files for each log file, generates initial HTML reports, and schedules a cron job for regular updates.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install GoAccess
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y goaccess

# Define directories
LOG_DIR="/var/log/nginx"
GOACCESS_CONF_DIR="/etc/goaccess"
WEB_REPORT_DIR="/var/www/html/goaccess-reports"

# Ensure directories exist
sudo mkdir -p "$GOACCESS_CONF_DIR"
sudo mkdir -p "$WEB_REPORT_DIR"

# Define log files explicitly

This script:
- Installs GoAccess.
- Defines directories for logs, GoAccess configurations, and web reports.
- Lists all your Nginx log files.
- Loops through each log file, creating a GoAccess configuration and generating an initial report.


- Optionally schedules a cron job for regular updates (commented out for review and customization).

Here’s an overview of how the script is supposed to work:

1. **Installation and Directory Setup**: It begins by installing GoAccess, then creating necessary directories for storing GoAccess config files (`$GOACCESS_CONF_DIR`) and HTML reports (`$WEB_REPORT_DIR`).

2. **Log File Definition**: The script uses an array (`log_files`) to list all the log files you want to analyze. This list should directly correspond to the actual log files present in your Nginx log directory (`$LOG_DIR`).

3. **Configuration and Report Generation**: For each log file listed, the script:
   - Extracts a base name to use for individual GoAccess configuration files and HTML reports.
   - Creates a GoAccess configuration file that points to the log file in `$LOG_DIR` and specifies the output path for the HTML report in `$WEB_REPORT_DIR`.
   - Runs GoAccess to generate an initial HTML report based on this configuration.

To access these reports via a web browser, you would need to configure your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to serve the contents of `$WEB_REPORT_DIR`. This involves setting up a server block or virtual host to point to the directory where the HTML reports are stored.

If there’s confusion or a mismatch between the log files specified in the script and those present on your system, you’ll need to ensure that the `log_files` array in the script accurately reflects the log files you intend to analyze with GoAccess. Each entry in the `log_files` array should match the filename of a log file in your Nginx log directory.

For direct assistance with script execution, file manipulation, or system configuration, I recommend working with a system administrator or a software developer who can access your server, verify the paths, and ensure the script runs as intended.
