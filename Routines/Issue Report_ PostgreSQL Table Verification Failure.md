A script execution intended to verify the existence of tables in a PostgreSQL database reported that none of the expected tables exist. This outcome followed the successful execution of a bootstrap script designed to create multiple schemas and tables within the `fountain` database, managed by the `play` user. The discrepancy between the successful table creation and the subsequent failure to verify these tables' existence necessitates a detailed analysis.

#### Test Results
The bootstrap execution script (`execute_bootstrap.sh`) was run, indicating successful table creation with multiple `CREATE TABLE` commands executed without error. This suggests that the necessary tables were indeed created within the `fountain` database.

Following this, the verification script (`check_table_mappings.sh`) was executed with the following input:
- Database name: `fountain`
- User: `play`

The output from the verification script reported that all expected tables do not exist, including but not limited to `scene.Scene`, `script.Script`, `characterrelationship.CharacterRelationship`, etc.

#### Analysis
The failure of the verification script to recognize the existence of tables that were reportedly created successfully points to potential issues in how the verification is conducted. Key areas of concern include:

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The tables might have been created in a specific schema, but the verification script could be checking in a different schema or not specifying the schema correctly.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: PostgreSQL is case-sensitive when dealing with quoted identifiers. If the creation script used quotes around table names or schemas, the exact casing must be used in the verification script.

3. **Connection Details**: There's a possibility that the verification script is not connecting to the correct database or schema due to incorrect or unspecified connection details.

#### Suggested Solution Strategy
To address the issue and ensure accurate verification of table existence, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Review and Standardize Naming Conventions**: Ensure that the table and schema names are consistently used across both the creation and verification scripts. Pay special attention to case sensitivity and quoted identifiers.

2. **Explicitly Specify Schema in Verification**: Modify the verification script to explicitly specify the schema when checking for table existence. This can be crucial if the tables are not in the default `public` schema.

3. **Manual Verification and Query Adjustment**: Manually connect to the database using `psql` and list the tables in the schemas of interest using `\dt schema.*`. Adjust the verification script based on the findings, particularly regarding case sensitivity and schema specification.

4. **Logging and Debugging**: Enhance the verification script to log detailed query outputs and errors. This can provide insights into the exact queries being run and how PostgreSQL is interpreting them.

5. **Permissions Review**: Ensure that the `play` user has the necessary permissions to access the tables and schemas in question. Lack of sufficient permissions could prevent the script from seeing the tables even if they exist.

#### Conclusion
The issue of the verification script failing to recognize the existence of tables, despite their successful creation, is likely due to mismatches in schema references, case sensitivity in table names, or connection details. By following the suggested solution strategy, particularly focusing on standardizing naming conventions and ensuring accurate schema specification, the discrepancy can be resolved, allowing for the correct verification of table existence in the PostgreSQL database.
