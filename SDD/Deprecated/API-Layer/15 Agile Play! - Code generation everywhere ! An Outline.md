
Since we started the development process of the Fountain backend with its functional definition in a bootstrap.sql script, all necessary information for a code generation process is already available. This includes entity names, fields, and their types, which obviates the need for an initial parameter acuisition and uses the information provided by the .sql directly to generate the models, schemas, services, and API routes. With full alembic integration, the expected output of running alembic migrations then becomes : what we exactly  _**input**_ ! Why is this useful? Well, let's see ...

### Step 1: Automated Parsing of Bootstrap Script

The first step in the process would involve parsing the SQL bootstrap script to extract entity definitions, including table names and column details. This automated parsing would identify each entity's name, fields, types, and any potential primary key or unique identifiers.

### Step 2: Code Generation Based on Parsed Information

Using the parsed information, the next steps would unfold as follows:

#### Models Generation

For every table defined in the bootstrap script, a corresponding SQLAlchemy model will be generated. For example, for the `Playwright` table:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Text
from database import Base

class Playwright(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'playwright'
    author_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
    biography = Column(Text)
    contact_information = Column(Text)
```

#### Schemas Generation

Pydantic models for each entity will be crafted to facilitate request validation and response serialization:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class PlaywrightBase(BaseModel):
    name: str
    biography: str | None = None
    contact_information: str | None = None

class PlaywrightCreate(PlaywrightBase):
    pass

class PlaywrightInDB(PlaywrightBase):
    author_id: int

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

#### CRUD Services and API Routes

CRUD operations and API routes will be scaffolded to provide a complete set of functionalities for interacting with each entity via the API.

### Step 3: Integration and Migration Dialogue

After generating all necessary components based on the script, the integration of models into Alembic for migration purposes and the inclusion of API routes into the FastAPI app would be outlined. Finally, a dialogue concerning the execution of migrations to update the database schema would be initiated, leveraging the generated models:

- **Automatic Migration Generation**: Instructions or commands for generating migration scripts based on the new models.
- **Application of Migrations**: Guidance on applying these migrations to the database.
- **Rollback Options**: Options for rolling back migrations if needed, ensuring the database's integrity and alignment with the codebase.

This streamlined process from parsing the bootstrap script to generating a fully functional API backend embodies the agility and efficiency required in modern web development, particularly in a microservices architecture. But, given the constraints and the aim for a seamless process, let's refocus and simplify the approach to minimize the burden on the user. 

Integrating directly with the project's existing structure and automating as much as possible, we'd ideally have a tool that requires minimal input to produce ready-to-use components. Let's streamline the process based on the information we already have:

1. **Automatic Detection and Parsing**: The script should automatically find and parse the `bootstrap.sql` file in the project directory, removing the need for manually specifying file paths or entity names.

2. **Direct File Writing**: Code for models, schemas, CRUD operations, and API routes should be directly written to the appropriate files in the project structure, with clear naming conventions that match the entity names. This process should also ensure that no existing files are overwritten without confirmation.

3. **Alembic Integration**: The script can automatically add newly generated models to Alembic's environment, preparing them for migration without additional steps required from the user.

4. **Simplified User Commands**: The entire process could be triggered by a simple command, with optional arguments for customization, rather than requiring a sequence of manual steps.

### Conceptual Example Command

```bash
python generate_fastapi_code.py --auto-detect
```

This command, when run in the project root, would:
- Automatically find `bootstrap.sql` in the project.
- Parse entity definitions from the SQL file.
- Generate and write all necessary components to their respective directories.
- Update Alembic configurations if needed.

### Example Implementation Adjustments

- **Automatic SQL File Discovery**: Update the script to search the project directory for `bootstrap.sql` or accept a path as an argument.
  
  ```python
  import glob
  
  def find_sql_file():
      sql_files = glob.glob("**/bootstrap.sql", recursive=True)
      return sql_files[0] if sql_files else None
  ```

- **Integration with Alembic**: Automatically modify Alembic's `env.py` to include new models for migration.

- **User Confirmation for File Writing**: Before overwriting any existing files, prompt the user for confirmation to avoid accidental data loss.

- **Verbose Output for User Clarity**: Provide detailed console output during the process, informing the user of each step being performed and any required actions on their part.

### Final Thoughts

Implementing a fully automated code generation tool that respects existing project structures and minimizes user intervention is a complex but achievable goal. The outlined adjustments and command streamline the process, making it more user-friendly and less prone to error or confusion. This approach ensures that the heavy lifting of code generation is managed by the tool, allowing the user to focus on more critical design and development aspects of their FastAPI application.

### ... and a try on shell scripting !

here it's !:

To directly address the requirement for a fully automated, practical script that sets up a FastAPI project with Alembic, generates models, schemas, CRUD operations, API routes, and handles Alembic migrations without manual adjustments, here is a concise version. This script will perform the specified tasks based on a given SQL definition, automatically integrating with Alembic for migrations.
