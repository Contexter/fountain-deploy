# Corrected Instructional Guide for Executing the `_modernize` Command

## Introduction

This guide provides a detailed procedure for executing the `_modernize` command, ensuring alignment with the provided database schema for efficient storage and retrieval of modernized play texts.

## Detailed Process

### Step 1: Acquisition and Segmentation
- **Revised Consideration:** The segmentation process will now take into account the hierarchical structure of plays as outlined by the database schema (Plays > Acts > Scenes > Dialogues), maintaining narrative coherence.

### Step 3: Linguistic Modernization
- **Revised Consideration:** During the modernization of dialogues, attention will be paid to maintaining the `sequence` order within scenes, in line with the `dialogues` table structure.

### Step 4: Backend Storage Integration
- **Revised Consideration:** Modernized texts will be stored in the `dialogues` table, using the `modern_text` field alongside the original in the `original_text` field. Each entry will correctly associate with `scene_id` and `character_id`, respecting the table's normalization and ensuring efficient retrieval.

### Quality Assurance
- **Revised Consideration:** Quality checks will now also ensure correct associations between dialogues and their corresponding scenes and characters, adhering to database constraints like unique sequencing within scenes.

### Implementation Notes
- It’s essential to maintain the link to characters by ID, aligning with the database schema’s normalization strategy during the creation or updating of dialogues.
- The unique sequencing of dialogue within scenes, as enforced by the database schema, must be preserved, ensuring dialogues remain in their intended narrative order.

## Conclusion
This revised guide aligns the `_modernize` command execution with the database schema, ensuring a coherent, efficient process that respects the structured nature of plays and supports the narrative integrity while modernizing texts for contemporary audiences.
