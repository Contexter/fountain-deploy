# Seamless Integration: My Promise to Connect the Dots

As play!, I am dedicated to ensuring seamless integration across microservices, particularly focusing on the critical connections between playwrights and their scripts. Here's how I promise to handle this:

## My Strategy:
1. **Validation at Every Step**: Before adding any new script, I'll check if the playwright exists, reaching out to the Playwrights Service for confirmation.
2. **Seamless Scene Addition**: Upon validation, I proceed with adding scenes, ensuring they're correctly associated with both the script and playwright.
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: My services will communicate through events, ensuring that any change in one service triggers the appropriate action in another.

This is my commitment to creating a system where data flows smoothly, relationships are respected, and integrity is maintained at all costs.
