Using MIDI 2.0 for non-musical data transmission to implement a .fountain play! viewer is an innovative approach that stretches the capabilities of MIDI beyond its original intent. This creative utilization **highlights MIDI 2.0's flexibility and its potential as a universal communication protocol.** 

Here's a conceptual framework for how this could be realized:

### Conceptual Framework for a .fountain play! Viewer Using MIDI 2.0

1. **Data Representation**:
   - **Encoding .fountain Content**: Develop a scheme to encode .fountain script elements (such as dialogue, action, character names) into MIDI messages. Given .fountain's plain text nature, this could involve mapping specific script elements to MIDI 2.0 messages or SysEx message payloads.
   - **Handling Complexity**: For complex script features (e.g., notes, sections, synopses), consider using MIDI 2.0's extended messages and the higher bandwidth of Universal MIDI Packets to encode detailed information.

2. **Viewer Communication**:
   - **MIDI Message Reception**: Implement a mechanism in the viewer to receive and decode MIDI messages. This could be a software layer that interprets incoming MIDI data and reconstructs the .fountain script for display.
   - **Real-time Updates**: Utilize MIDI 2.0's improved speed and efficiency to facilitate real-time updates to the script viewer, reflecting changes as they are made in the play! session.

3. **Bidirectional Interaction**:
   - **Viewer Feedback**: Explore MIDI 2.0's bidirectional capabilities to allow the viewer to send feedback or commands back to the play! session. This could enable interactive elements within the script or adjustments to the play! session based on viewer input.

4. **Interoperability and Compatibility**:
   - **Backward Compatibility**: Leverage MIDI 2.0's backward compatibility to ensure that the system can interact with existing MIDI infrastructure, potentially allowing for a wide range of devices and software to interact with the .fountain play! viewer.
   - **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure the viewer and the encoding/decoding system are designed to be cross-platform, facilitating broader accessibility and usability across different devices and operating systems.

5. **Security and Reliability**:
   - **Data Integrity**: Implement robust error-checking and data validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the transmitted .fountain content.
   - **Reliable Transmission**: Address potential challenges in transmitting large or complex scripts, ensuring that the system can handle substantial data loads without loss or corruption.

### Implementation Considerations
- **Development Effort**: This approach requires significant custom development, including the creation of the encoding/decoding scheme and the integration of MIDI 2.0 communication into the viewer.
- **Use Case Validation**: While this implementation showcases the versatility of MIDI 2.0, it's essential to validate the use case against traditional data transmission methods to ensure that the benefits outweigh the complexities.

### Conclusion
Using MIDI 2.0 for a .fountain play! viewer represents a bold reimagining of what MIDI can do, extending its application from musical to textual data transmission. This concept not only underscores the adaptability of MIDI 2.0 but also opens up new avenues for creative and interactive applications in scriptwriting and beyond. With careful planning and innovative design, this approach could offer a unique and engaging way to experience .fountain scripts.
