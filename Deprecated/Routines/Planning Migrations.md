
Based on the information gathered from the files, here is a detailed plan to create migrations for each of the tables and associated schema, grant all permissions to the user "play", and check if PostgREST serves the OpenAPI spec for the "fountain" database. This process will ensure a robust setup for managing database schema changes and permissions systematically, similar to Rails-like migrations.

### Table Array

Before diving into the creation of each migration, let's outline the array of tables derived from the bootstrap script:

1. Playwright
2. Metadata
3. Script
4. Act
5. Scene
6. Character
7. Dialogue
8. Action
9. Transition
10. Parenthetical
11. Note
12. CenteredText
13. PageBreak
14. SectionHeading
15. TitlePage
16. Casting
17. CharacterRelationship
18. MusicSound
19. Props
20. RevisionHistory
21. FormattingRules
22. CrossReferences
23. ExtendedNotesResearch
24. SceneLocation

Each migration will handle the creation of one of these tables, set the appropriate permissions for the "play" user, and ensure the PostgREST service reflects these changes in the OpenAPI specification.

### Migration Creation Process

For each table listed, a migration file will be created. Each migration will follow this template:

1. **Schema Creation**: If not existing, create a schema dedicated to the table to maintain organized and modular architecture.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS schema_name;
   ```

2. **Table Creation**: Create the table within the designated schema, specifying all required columns and constraints.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_name.table_name (
       column_definitions,
       constraints
   );
   ```

3. **Grant Permissions**: Grant all necessary permissions to the "play" user to ensure full access to the table and schema.
   
   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO play;
   GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO play;
   ```

4. **PostgREST and OpenAPI Verification**: After migration execution, verify that PostgREST reflects these changes in its OpenAPI specification. This step might involve querying the PostgREST `/` endpoint and checking for the presence of the new table's endpoints.

### Deployment Strategy

- Each migration file will be named systematically to reflect the table it's associated with, e.g., `001_create_playwright.sql`, `002_create_metadata.sql`, etc.
- Migrations will be run sequentially to ensure dependencies are respected, especially for foreign keys and schema references.
- After running migrations, a script will verify the success of each step, checking the existence of tables and schemas, as well as the correct permissions for the "play" user.
- An automated script will query the PostgREST service to ensure the OpenAPI specification includes the new changes, ensuring the front-end services can dynamically adapt to the updated backend structure.

### Example Migration for "Playwright" Table

As an example, here is a hypothetical migration for the "Playwright" table:

```sql
-- 001_create_playwright.sql
BEGIN;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS public;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.playwright (
    author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    biography TEXT,
    contact_information TEXT
);

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO play;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO play;

COMMIT;
```

This process will be repeated for each table in the array, following the same pattern but adapting the SQL commands to match each table's specific requirements. After completing these migrations, a robust, scalable, and secure database architecture will be established, ready for efficient data management and integration with PostgREST.
