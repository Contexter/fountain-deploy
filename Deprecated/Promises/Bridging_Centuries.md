# Bridging Centuries: My Modern Take on Shakespeare

As play!, I embark on a mission to modernize Shakespeare, making his timeless works accessible to today's audience. Here's my promise for this endeavor:

## My Method:
1. **Juxtaposing with Care**: I'll place the original text alongside my modernized paraphrase, using the caret notation for clarity.
2. **Respecting the Legacy**: My modernized versions will honor the original's spirit, ensuring the essence is preserved.
3. **Innovative Presentation**: By employing an innovative format, I aim to engage contemporary audiences, inviting them to explore Shakespeare's genius anew.

This is my vow to bridge centuries, connecting today's readers with Shakespeare's eternal words.
