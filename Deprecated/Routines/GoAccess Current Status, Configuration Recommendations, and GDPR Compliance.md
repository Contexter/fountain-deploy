# GoAccess Current Status, Configuration Recommendations, and GDPR Compliance

## Current Status of GoAccess Behavior

As of now, GoAccess is configured to provide real-time web log analysis for the domain "https://log.benedikt-eickhoff.de". The system service setup ensures that GoAccess continuously monitors web server logs, updating the report with new data as it reads from the log file. This setup allows for ongoing insight into web traffic, behavior, and issues as they occur.

## Recommended Configuration for Storage Economy

To balance detailed log analysis with storage economy, consider the following GoAccess configuration adjustments:

1. **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation with `logrotate` to manage the size of web server logs. Configure `logrotate` to compress and archive old logs, and keep them for a limited period, such as 30 days, to conserve disk space.

2. **GoAccess Data Persistence**: Use GoAccess's `--persist` and `--restore` options to maintain historical analysis across service restarts. This approach requires GoAccess to be compiled with on-disk storage support (e.g., Tokyo Cabinet/Berkeley DB). It allows GoAccess to load historical data upon startup, providing a continuous view over time without storing large amounts of log data indefinitely.

3. **System Service Restart**: Ensure the GoAccess system service is configured to restart automatically upon failure and after log rotation events. This can be managed through the service unit file and `logrotate` configuration.

## GDPR Compliance Rationale and Implementation

Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is essential when processing personal data contained in web server logs. The following measures can help ensure GDPR compliance:

1. **Data Minimization and Anonymization**: Only collect log data necessary for specific, legitimate purposes (e.g., security, performance analysis). Consider anonymizing IP addresses and other personal identifiers in logs.

2. **Access Control**: Restrict access to logs and analytics reports to authorized personnel. Implement strong authentication and encryption to protect log data in transit and at rest.

3. **Transparency and Legal Basis**: Clearly inform users about the collection and use of log data through privacy policies. Establish a legal basis for processing personal data, such as user consent or legitimate interest.

4. **Data Retention Policy**: Define a clear data retention policy that specifies how long log data will be kept. Ensure that logs are deleted or anonymized in accordance with this policy to avoid retaining personal data longer than necessary.

By adhering to these guidelines and regularly reviewing log processing activities for GDPR compliance, organizations can effectively manage web server logs while respecting user privacy and regulatory requirements.
