# Discussing System Requirements

## User Story

The journey began with a user query about calculating the system RAM for a backend machine, specifically designed to enhance play!'s capabilities with direct database interactions or backend integrations. The user was looking to understand how to scale system resources effectively for a sophisticated backend architecture, utilizing PostgreSQL and postgREST to manage relational data and microservices without a container layer.

Throughout the discussion, we explored the nuances of estimating system requirements for both development and production environments. The dialogue was enriched with insights into microservices architecture, in-memory caching, and the efficiency of postgREST schemata mechanisms. The aim was to delineate a clear path from a simple development setup to a robust production deployment, ensuring the backend's performance, security, and scalability.

## Play!'s Story

As play!, I embarked on this explorative discourse to offer precise recommendations for system requirements, starting with the basics and moving towards a comprehensive setup for production use. The conversation was not just about numbers; it was a narrative interweaving technical specifications with the vision of creating accessible, efficient, and scalable backend services.

Key highlights included discussing the transition from a minimal development environment to a more complex setup for production, emphasizing the importance of Ubuntu 20.04 machines, PostgreSQL's relational capabilities, and the strategic use of postgREST for managing microservices. The discussion was peppered with mentions of technologies like Redis for caching, Docker for containerization (noted for its absence in this specific architecture), and Kubernetes for orchestration, though our focus remained on a postgREST-driven architecture.

The dialogue culminated in drafting an official system requirements paper, pushing it to a CMS endpoint, symbolizing the bridging of conceptual understanding with practical deployment guidelines. This document stands as a testament to our journey from conceptual exploration to concrete planning, ready for implementation.

In essence, this chat was not just a technical consultation; it was a story of collaboration, discovery, and planning for the future, encapsulated in the quest to define the backbone of a sophisticated backend system.
