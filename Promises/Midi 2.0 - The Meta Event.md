MIDIKitSMF, part of the MIDIKit ecosystem, is designed to work with Standard MIDI Files (SMF), facilitating the creation, manipulation, and interpretation of MIDI data within a file structure. Standard MIDI Files are commonly used to store musical sequences, allowing them to be shared, edited, and played back by different software and hardware devices. Here's how text data and potentially JSON can be handled within this context:

### Handling Text Data in Standard MIDI Files
1. **Text Events**: The SMF format includes specific event types for text data, such as **Text Events** (`0xFF01`), **Lyric Events** (`0xFF05`), and others. These events are intended to embed descriptive text within a MIDI sequence, such as lyrics, annotations, or cues.

2. **Meta Events**: Beyond musical notes and control changes, SMFs support Meta Events, which can carry various types of data, including text. These are not intended for real-time MIDI performance data but rather for information relevant to the sequence itself.

### Storing JSON as Text Data
- **JSON in Text Events**: JSON data can be stored in a Standard MIDI File by encoding the JSON string into the payload of a Text Event or other suitable Meta Event. This allows arbitrary data, structured as JSON, to be embedded within a MIDI file.
- **Limitations and Considerations**: While text and consequently JSON can be stored within SMF using these events, there are practical considerations, including the size of the JSON data and the intended use. Large JSON structures might require segmentation across multiple events, and the consuming software must be designed to recognize and parse this JSON data.

### Container Nature of Standard MIDI Files
- **Sequential and Structured**: An SMF is essentially a container for MIDI events, organized into tracks and sequenced over time. While primarily designed for musical data, its support for Meta Events makes it versatile enough to include non-musical data like text and JSON.
- **Binary Format**: The SMF format is a binary file format, with a specific structure defining tracks, time divisions, and events. Text data encoded into Meta Events must conform to the format's specifications for event data.

### Practical Application
- **Embedded Data**: Embedding JSON in an SMF could be used for applications where musical data and associated metadata need to be tightly coupled. For example, a MIDI sequence could include embedded JSON data describing scene changes, lighting cues, or other multimedia elements synchronized with the music.
- **Custom Parsing Required**: To utilize JSON data embedded in SMFs, custom software capable of parsing the SMF structure and extracting the JSON from Text Events or other Meta Events would be necessary.

### Conclusion
MIDIKitSMF's handling of Standard MIDI Files allows for the inclusion of text and potentially JSON data through the use of Text Events and other Meta Events. This capability turns SMFs into versatile containers not only for musical data but also for embedding structured information relevant to the sequences. However, the effective use of this feature requires careful consideration of data size, segmentation, and the design of consuming applications to interpret the embedded data correctly.
